 Twitter Data Analysis in Python.

  The Project illustrates the way how we can approach working with 
  JSON formatted data and use Twitter API to get the result weâ€™re looking for.

The basic workFlow for all three programs is the following:

1) Initialize data structures;
2) Open user speciFied data File;
3) Read all tweets (lines) from the text File;
4) Process the data for each tweet (line by line);
5) Analyze and summarize the result;
6) Report the result.
